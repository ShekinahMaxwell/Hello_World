               <h3> Description</h3>
               <p>  The black-footed cat, also called the small-spotted cat, is the smallest wild cat in Africa, having a head-and-body length of about 14–20 in. Despite its name, only the soles of its feet are black or dark brown. With its bold small spots and stripes on the tawny fur, it is well camouflaged, especially on moonlit nights. It bears black streaks running from the corners of the eyes along the cheeks, and its banded tail has a black tip.</p>

               <h3> Habitat & Diet </h3>
               <p> Black-footed cats are native to arid regions and grassland savannas of southern Africa. They have been recorded to exist in areas such as Nambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Botswana, though their numbers have drastically declined over the years.</p>
               <p> They hunt by stalking and then pouncing on their prey. In nature, their diets include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Small mammals and birds </li>
                    <li> Insects </li>
                    <li> Arachnids </li>
                    <li> Small reptiles </li>
                </ol>

               <h3> Endangered </h3>
               <p> Like their larger cousins, small cats are threatened by the loss of valuable habitat and prey, indiscriminate killing, and conflict with humans, livestock, and domestic animals. <blockquote> “We don’t own the planet Earth, we belong to it. And we must share it with our wildlife.” <cite> – Steve Irwin</cite> </blockquote> </p> 
               <p> Compared to other carnivores, very little is known about the small cats. With sparse information, it is difficult to obtain funding for conservation projects, provide protection for them, or establish conservation standards. Small Wild Cat Conservation Foundation (SWCCF) is leading the way in protecting small endangered cats around the world. <a href="https://wildnet.org/wildlife-programs/small-wild-cats/"> Donate</a> today&#128062 </p>
